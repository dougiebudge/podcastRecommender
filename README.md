## Desert Island Discs Recommender ##
This repo is a learning project for me. I want to attempt to build a recommender system for a novel dataset so I can apply what I've learned in other online tutorials.

The project uses a csv of desert island disc podcasts' metadata and the aim is to recommend new episodes similar to one provided.
As a first pass I want to vectorize the metadata and generate a similarity score for all the castaways. 

Extra steps: Improve the model by adding more context to the features (song genres, book synopses and wikipedia articles on the castaways).
